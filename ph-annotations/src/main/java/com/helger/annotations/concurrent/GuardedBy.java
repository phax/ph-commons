/**
 * The field or method to which this annotation is applied can only be accessed when holding a
 * particular lock, which may be a built-in (synchronization) lock, or may be an explicit
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}.
 * <p>
 * The argument determines which lock guards the annotated field or method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>this : The string literal "this" means that this field is guarded by the class in which it is
 * defined.</li>
 * <li>class-name.this : For inner classes, it may be necessary to disambiguate 'this'; the
 * class-name.this designation allows you to specify which 'this' reference is intended</li>
 * <li>itself : For reference fields only; the object to which the field refers.</li>
 * <li>field-name : The lock object is referenced by the (instance or static) field specified by
 * field-name.</li>
 * <li>class-name.field-name : The lock object is reference by the static field specified by
 * class-name.field-name.</li>
 * <li>method-name() : The lock object is returned by calling the named nil-ary method.</li>
 * <li>class-name.class : The Class object for the specified class should be used as the lock
 * object.</li>
 * </ul>
