 * To complete the Mac computation, call one of the <code>doFinal</code> methods
 * on the associated Mac after your calls to one of this Mac input stream's
 * {@link #read() read} methods.
 * <p>
 * It is possible to turn this stream on or off (see {@link #setOn(boolean)

 * Note that Mac objects can compute only one digest (see {@link Mac}), so that
 * in order to compute intermediate digests, a caller should retain a handle
 * onto the Mac object, and clone it for each digest to be computed, leaving the
 * original digest untouched.
