   * A server-specified data string which should be uniquely generated each time a 401 response is
   * made. It is recommended that this string be base64 or hexadecimal data. Specifically, since the
   * string is passed in the header lines as a quoted string, the double-quote character is not
   * allowed.<br>
   * The contents of the nonce are implementation dependent. The quality of the implementation
   * depends on a good choice. A nonce might, for example, be constructed as the base 64 encoding
   * of<br>
   * time-stamp H(time-stamp ":" ETag ":" private-key)<br>
   * where time-stamp is a server-generated time or other non-repeating value, ETag is the value of
   * the HTTP ETag header associated with the requested entity, and private-key is data known only
   * to the server. With a nonce of this form a server would recalculate the hash portion after
   * receiving the client authentication header and reject the request if it did not match the nonce
   * from that header or if the time-stamp value is not recent enough. In this way the server can
   * limit the time of the nonceâ€™s validity. The inclusion of the ETag prevents a replay request for
   * an updated version of the resource. (Note: including the IP address of the client in the nonce
   * would appear to offer the server the ability to limit the reuse of the nonce to the same client
   * that originally got it. However, that would break proxy farms, where requests from a single
   * user often go through different proxies in the farm. Also, IP address spoofing is not that
   * hard.)<br>
   * An implementation might choose not to accept a previously used nonce or a previously used
   * digest, in order to protect against a replay attack. Or, an implementation might choose to use
   * one-time nonces or digests for POST or PUT requests and a time-stamp for GET requests. For more
