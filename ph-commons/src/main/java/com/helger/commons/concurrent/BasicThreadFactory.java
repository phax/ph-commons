/**
 * <p>
 * An implementation of the {@code ThreadFactory} interface that provides some configuration options
 * for the threads it creates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ThreadFactory} is used for instance by an {@code ExecutorService} to create the threads
 * it uses for executing tasks. In many cases users do not have to care about a
 * {@code ThreadFactory} because the default one used by an {@code ExecutorService} will do.
 * However, if there are special requirements for the threads, a custom {@code ThreadFactory} has to
 * be created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class provides some frequently needed configuration options for the threads it creates.
 * These are the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A name pattern for the threads created by this factory can be specified. This is often useful
 * if an application uses multiple executor services for different purposes. If the names of the
 * threads used by these services have meaningful names, log output or exception traces can be much
 * easier to read. Naming patterns are <em>format strings</em> as used by the {@code
 * String.format()} method. The string can contain the place holder {@code %d} which will be
 * replaced by the number of the current thread ({@code
 * ThreadFactoryImpl} keeps a counter of the threads it has already created). For instance, the
 * naming pattern {@code "My %d. worker thread"} will result in thread names like
 * {@code "My 1. worker thread"}, {@code
 * "My 2. worker thread"} and so on.</li>
 * <li>A flag whether the threads created by this factory should be daemon threads. This can impact
 * the exit behavior of the current Java application because the JVM shuts down if there are only
 * daemon threads running.</li>
 * <li>The priority of the thread. Here an integer value can be provided. The
 * {@code java.lang.Thread} class defines constants for valid ranges of priority values.</li>
 * <li>The {@code UncaughtExceptionHandler} for the thread. This handler is called if an uncaught
 * exception occurs within the thread.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@code BasicThreadFactory} wraps another thread factory which actually creates new threads. The
 * configuration options are set on the threads created by the wrapped thread factory. On
 * construction time the factory to be wrapped can be specified. If none is provided, a default
 * {@code ThreadFactory} is used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@code BasicThreadFactory} are not created directly, but the nested {@code Builder}
 * class is used for this purpose. Using the builder only the configuration options an application
 * is interested in need to be set. The following example shows how a {@code BasicThreadFactory} is
 * created and installed in an {@code ExecutorService}:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create a factory that produces daemon threads with a naming pattern and
 * // a priority
 * BasicThreadFactory factory = new BasicThreadFactory.Builder ().setNamingPattern (&quot;workerthread-%d&quot;)
 *                                                               .setDaemon (true)
 *                                                               .setPriority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY)
 *                                                               .build ();
 * // Create an executor service for single-threaded execution
 * ExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor (factory);
 * </pre>
 *
