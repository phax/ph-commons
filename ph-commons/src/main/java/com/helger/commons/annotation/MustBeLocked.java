/**
 * Just to indicate that a method must be called inside a lock. When using
 * read-write locks (class ReadWriteLock), please choose the lock type
 * carefully. When using exclusive locks (class Lock) use the lock type
 * <code>WRITE</code>. The constraint of this annotation is also fulfilled when
 * a method is called inside the constructor of the owning class, as
 * constructor-calls of a single object are not accessed by multiple threads in
 * parallel.
